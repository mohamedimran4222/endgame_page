        <b> Avengers: Endgame </b>is a 2019 American superhero film based on the
        Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers, produced by Marvel Studios
        and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the direct
        sequel to Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and the 22nd film in the<b
          >Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).</b
        >
        It was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher
        Markus and Stephen McFeely, and features an ensemble cast including
        Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett
        Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen
        Gillan, Danai Gurira, Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, Bradley Cooper,
        Gwyneth Paltrow, and Josh Brolin. In the film, the surviving members of
        the Avengers and their allies attempt to reverse the damage caused by
        Thanos in Infinity War. The film was announced in October 2014 as
        Avengers: Infinity War â€“ Part 2, but Marvel later removed this title.
        The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and
        McFeely signing on to write the script a month later. The film serves as
        a conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the story
        arcs for several main characters. Filming began in August 2017 at
        <i> Pinewood Atlanta Studios</i> in Fayette County, Georgia, shooting
        back-to-back with Infinity War, and ended in January 2018. Additional
        filming took place in the Metro and Downtown Atlanta areas, New York,
        Scotland, and England. The story revisits several moments from earlier
        films, bringing back actors and settings from throughout the franchise
        as well as music from previous films. The official title was revealed in
        December 2018. With an estimated budget of $356 million, it is one of
        the most expensive films ever made.
